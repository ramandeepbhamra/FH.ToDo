## 🧪 Running Tests

### Via Visual Studio

1. **Start Frontend First:**
   ```powershell
   cd FH.ToDo.Frontend
   npm start
   ```

2. **In Visual Studio:**
   - Right-click `FH.ToDo.Tests.Playwright` project
   - Select **"Build"** or **"Rebuild"**
   - Tests run automatically after build

### Via Command Line

```powershell
# Run all tests (headless)
npm test

# Run with UI mode (interactive)

## 🔧 Visual Studio Integration

The `.csproj` file provides MSBuild integration:

**What happens when you build:**
1. `NpmInstall` target → runs `npm install`
2. `PlaywrightInstall` target → installs Chromium browser
3. `RunPlaywrightTests` target → runs `npm test`

**Disable auto-run tests:**  
Comment out the `RunPlaywrightTests` target in `.csproj` if you only want to install dependencies without running tests.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Navigation timeout"

**Cause:** Frontend not running at `http://localhost:4200`

**Solution:**
```powershell
cd ..\FH.ToDo.Frontend
npm start
```

### Issue: "Chromium not installed"

**Solution:**
```powershell
npx playwright install chromium
```

### Issue: "Test fails - button not found"

**Cause:** Frontend routing or button text changed

**Solution:** Check the button text in `src/app/shared/components/app-navigation/`
